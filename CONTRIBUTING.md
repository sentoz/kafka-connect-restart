# Making changes to the project

You decided to contribute to the overall project, and that's great! I
welcome this!

But you must understand all the responsibility, this project is used, and if
you change something, you should be, we are sure that you did not harm anyone.

Therefore, i have a number of requirements and wishes, please read them first.

## Primary requirements

* We merge all the developments into the `main` branch (we work only with it).
* When we make a new feature, we name the branch `feature_*`
* When we fix something, we name the branch `fix_*`
* Donâ€™t forget to update `CHANGELOG.md` before opening MP
* If something has changed, we check the relevance of the documentation
* In the body of the MR we describe clearly what has changed and why, if there is a issue,
   then we refer to it
* If the MR is open but not yet ready, keep it in status
   [draft][] until it's ready
* Commits are named according to [conventional commits][]
   _(you can add emoji but not recommended)_
